This module has been created to provide functions that are useful in pricing and risk management of 
fixed-income securities. The goal is to break-down complex quantitative financial calculations into
easy-to-understand functions as much as possible. 

To begin with, there are two functions: 
    duration: calculates the Macaulay and Modified Durations.
    bondprice: provides an estimated price for a security for a given basis point change.
    
More functions will be added periodically.
